SDLino

SDLino is a partial implementation (editor/compiler) of ITU-T Z.100/SDL
targeting the Arduino platform.

For those unfamiliar with SDL; It is a graphical programming language, basically
a mix of Flow Charts and State Transition diagrams, and module interaction
diagrams.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_and_Description_Language

For those unfamiliar with Arduino; It is a simplified micro-controler development
platform based on C. http://arduino.cc/

The project is being written in JS and C, the parts that are there are being
run only on Firefox so far. Finally there should be a node.js server to
compile & upload the output, and to store the projects to the filesystem.
The output and its runtime library are to be in C, parts exist already from
past attempts and are to be refactored.

Current Status: I'sd say 30% up to pre-alpha release...

Some of the frontend (browser) code is there already:

DiagramState.js manages flowcharting, is buggy but almost there.
HtmlDlg.js creates pop-up dialogs using <form>s... more cosmetic changes are needed...
POM.js manages localStorage of complex objects... to be tested/used/maybe refactored

The backend SDL data model and the "spaghetti code compiler" (a.k.a PastaMatic)
is already in my head and very stable since I've got this thing bugging my
brains for years. First will be run in the browser, later in the node.js server,
Yes, I love JS. The Arduino runtime is coming paralel with the compiler...

Licence, at least for now, is to be GPL for everything: Even the generated
code...  until I find a proper licensing recipe.
