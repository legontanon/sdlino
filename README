SDLino

SDLino is a partial implementation (editor/compiler) of ITU-T Z.100/SDL
targeting the Arduino platform.

For those unfamiliar with SDL is a graphical programming language, basically
a mix of Flow Charts and State Transition diagrams, and module interaction
diagrams.

For those unfamiliar with Arduino; It is a micro-controler development
platform based in C.

The project is being written in JS, the parts that are there are being run only on
Firefox so far. Finally there should be a node.js server to compile & upload
the output, and to store the projects to the filesystem.

Current Status: I'sd say 25% up to pre-alpha release...

Some of the frontend (browser) code is there already:

DiagramState.js manages flowcharting, is buggy but almost there.
HtmlDlg.js creates pop-up dialogs using <form>s... more cosmetics...
POM.js manages localStorage of complex objects... to be tested/used/maybe refactored

The backend SDL data model and the "spaghetti code compiler" (a.k.a PastaMatic)
is already in my head and very stable since I've got this thing bugging my
brains for years. First will be run in the browser, later in the node.js server,
Yes, I love JS. The Arduino runtime is coming paralel with the compiler...

Licence is GPL for everything (Even the generated code...) until I find a
propper licencing recipe.
